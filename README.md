# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project is about predicting rainfall based on some parameters like Temperature, Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Dew Point. Humidity, Visibility, Wind. We got 27% as the accuracy based on the dataset, as we see the corelation between the attributes is low.
